## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kuldeep-shr/dental-stall-scraper.git

   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```ini
   API_TOKEN=your_api_token
   CACHE_HOST=your_cache_host
   CACHE_PORT=your_cache_port
   PROXY=http://your_proxy_server:port
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the FastAPI server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

2. **Access the API documentation:**

   Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to explore the available endpoints using the interactive Swagger UI.

## üõ† API Endpoints

### Authentication

All endpoints require a valid `API_TOKEN` passed in the Authorization header.

### Scrape Products

- **POST /api/scrape**

  Scrape products from the Dental Stall website.

  **Request:**

  ```json
  {
    "num_pages": 1
  }
  ```

  **Response:**

  ```json
  {
    "message": "Scraping completed"
  }
  ```

## üåê Environment Variables

Ensure you have a `.env` file with the following variables:

```ini
API_TOKEN=your_api_token
CACHE_HOST=your_cache_host
CACHE_PORT=your_cache_port
PROXY=http://your_proxy_server:port
```

## üîÑ Cache Management

The scraper uses a TTL (Time-To-Live) cache to store product data temporarily. This helps reduce redundant requests and speeds up the scraping process.
